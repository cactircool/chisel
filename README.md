# chisel

A highly optimized static parser generator for C++.

## Build

```
go build -o chisel.out
```

## TODO

[] Make the default where all library files are included separately (make a way for the user to extract specific classes as their own file)
[] Work on highly optimized data structures for the full scope of the Parser
[] Create a --help menu
